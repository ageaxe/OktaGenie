# OktaGenie WebEx Chatbot

## Problem Statement

Managing and retrieving information from Okta's extensive documentation, including the Admin Guide, Developer Guide, and Public Discussion Forum, can be challenging for users. The need for quick and accurate information retrieval is crucial for efficient problem-solving and decision-making.

## Technical Solution

The OktaGenie WebEx Chatbot is designed to address this challenge by providing a conversational interface that leverages advanced AI techniques to retrieve and generate relevant information from Okta's documentation. The chatbot is implemented using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Llama 2 8B locally, ensuring that users receive accurate and contextually relevant responses.

### Key Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses.
- **Llama 2 8B:** Utilizes the Llama 2 8B model for natural language understanding and generation.
- **LangChain:** The solution is built using LangChain, a framework for developing applications powered by language models.
- **WebEx Integration:** Once the user is satisfied with the data, they are provided with a WebEx form to act on the information provided.
